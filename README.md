# CameraCalib
Source code for calibrating the camera via opencv. <br />
For using this program just: <br />
If you use the calibration pattern provided in this repository, just enter a n number of ".jpg" images, change the variable num_imgs to the number of images you want to enter. Otherwise you will need to change the parameters board_w and board_h. <br />
